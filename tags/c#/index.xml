      <description>Awkwardly wondering what to do after you get through your first C# tutorials? Learned the C# syntax, but now what?  Intermediate C# Developer  This post builds off my last to help direct you on your path to becoming a professional C# developer. This material will be right for you if you have been working with C# for about 3-6 months. There is some wiggle room in those numbers, as there always is, but if you are entirely unfamiliar with C#, please go here : Learning C#.</description>

      <description>Ready to take you C# skills to the next level?? When I got started learning C# I looked to PluralSight . This has proven to be a great choice! There are literally weeks worth of great C# and .Net content. While I did not get started advancing my C# knowledge THAT long ago, it was before PluralSight started offering &amp;ldquo;Paths&amp;rdquo;. At that time, way back when, they had just a few old blog posts to guide me on where to get started, and which order to watch some videos in.</description>

      <description>Should I Learn C#?  Why should you choose to learn C# out of all the other languages? Perhaps you are trying to decided between it and Java, or Python, or C, or JavaScript, or [insert other great language choice]. Well quite simply you should choose C# to learn now, because C# is the best! &amp;hellip; Is what I wish I could say, but truly there are many different programming languages and most have varying pros and cons for many applications.</description>
