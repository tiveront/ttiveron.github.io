#### I love applying technology to traditional fields, providing eloquent solutions to complex problems!

I NEVER waste an opportunity to learn, and have been leveraging my engineering mindset to quickly develop new skills every chance that I get + whatever I can squeeze in on a Sunday :p

From server room design, HVAC and electrical planning, to server administration, and software development, both life-cycle management and programming, I am always up for a challenge.

I hope you find here a solution to a problem of yours! If you think I can help you out, feel free to contact me below. Thanks for reading!
