## Where's my time going?

Hello readers (mom),
I apologize for my loooong delay between post. I can hardly believe it is already spring time. Whew, time is traveling quickly now. What have you been up to so far this year? I hope something fulfilling!

Myself, I've been continuing to work very hard with <a href="http://www.icarusgv.com/" target="\_blank"> Icarus Group Ventures, </a> really expanding our automated trading platform. In this always changing space, you have to stay agile. Then I've taken on building a desktop application for an engineering firm. On this project, I am on my own, so designer, manager, developer! Focused on maintainability, I'm following test driven development (TDD) principles and love it. These two project are definitely taking up the vast majority of my time, but I'm always trying to keep learning.

On the learning front, I've launched two open source projects <a href="https://github.com/ttiveron" target="\_blank">(my rad Github).</a> One is the theme to this blog, <a href="https://github.com/ttiveron/beautifultom" target="\_blank">beautifultom</a>, and the other is a tool for creating rainfall files that work with EPA SWMM, <a href="https://github.com/ttiveron/EPA-SWMM-Rainfall-File-Creator" target="\_blank">EPA SWMM Rainfall File Creator</a>.
I'm hoping to learn more about Git, while learning to manage a OS project, and working with other developers! I hope that you find either of these tools useful and will help me out making them better for everyone.

#### I'm hoping over the next month or so to post some regular updates on the following topics:

* Details on the EPA SWMM Rainfall File Creator
* Details on beautifultom
* C# - await... await... await... TASK!
* Enterprise Storage Frameworks
* Seven Programming Languages in Seven Weeks

Thanks for reading,

Thomas
