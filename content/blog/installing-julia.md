### R or Python for Data Science

So you want to be a data scientist, but are stuck on the first polarizing decision of learning R or Python... I'm going to try to help you!

I'm also going to attempt to not make this post follow the typical "R is maybe the best, or Python, or neither", as I find these kind of articles informative, but not helpful to a beginner. If you are wanting a break down of R and Python's strengths, ease of learning, salaries, etc. you can find soo many with Google, I'll even save you the work of typing it in -  [R or Python](https://www.google.com/?gfe_rd=cr&ei=IV98V8bMLYKN8Qf3vbOwBw#q=R+or+Python "R or Python Google Search Results").
What I always find is that while their infographics are detailed and interesting, reviewing them does not help you make the decision of which to start learning. So that is what I'll try to do here, in just few simple questions.

*Disclaimer : I'm neither an R nor a Python expert, but I think my little bit of experience with both can set you on the right path*

#### 1. Do have a data set and a problem in mind?

##### Yes - R
##### No - Python

I feel this question may split developers and academics (generalizing a lot here). Academics typically have a thesis, which is a set problem they are wanting to solve, and are looking to a data science language to beef-up what they might have tried to do in Excel. In contrast, developers, may be wanting to find work with a company and be looking to a data science language to add valuable insight to business data.
With these two needs in mind, I think the academic approaching a problem with a mathematical rigor could find R a great place to start, and the developer looking to hack together business data, could find Python great.

TL;DR
If you have a dataset (sensorlogs.csv, or a database) you're going be able to get up and running very quickly and answering questions with R. If you need to scrap a website, hack together program outputs, you may need the flexibility of Python to get things together.

#### 2. Do you have programming experience?

##### Yes - R
##### No - Python


TL;DR
If you already know a multi-paradigm language and can build applications you may want to learn R to approach your data problems from a different angle. If you have never programmed before you may want to learn Python, as you will be able to use your new knowledge for future projects.


### Nassim Taleb and Julia

The first technical challenge which will siphon hours of Google research is where will your blog live??

I knew I wanted my own domain and settled on [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/ "Namescheap") because they had the best value for domain registration and email hosting.
Some services offer many more features, but seeing as I will not be requiring a lot of features for this simple blog, Namecheap's offering was perfect.

Following my domain purchase and email setup, I stared down the barrel of hosting options and blogging platforms.

I reviewed hosting with Dreamhost, Digital Ocean, and a few others. I reviewed VPS options like Azure, and Linode (wouldn't it be fun to admin a Linux server!).
And I considered your classic WordPress, and the new blogging focused Ghost platforms.
But at the end of the day, I didn't really want to have to start paying for a hosting subscription at the start, and then I stumbled upon [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/ "Github Pages").
