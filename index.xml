&lt;h2&gt; Ready to take you C# skills to the next level??&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got started learning C# I looked to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pluralsight.com&#34; target=&#34;\_blank&#34;&gt; PluralSight &lt;/a&gt;. This has proven to be a great choice! There are literally weeks worth of great C# and .Net content. While I did not get started advancing my C# knowledge THAT long ago, it was before PluralSight started offering &amp;ldquo;Paths&amp;rdquo;. At that time, way back when, they had just a few old blog posts to guide me on where to get started, and which order to watch some videos in. With the release of PluralSight&amp;rsquo;s C# Path I started comparing my learning track with theirs&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may be bias - but I think mine&amp;rsquo;s better! So I&amp;rsquo;m going to share it with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: If you are entirely new to C# check out my blog post for you here : &lt;a href=&#34;http://tiveron.ca/blog/learning-csharp/&#34; title=&#34;Thomas Tiveron&#39;s Learning C#&#34;&gt;Learning C#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Advanced Foundations Level &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; Duration : 20 hours 13 minutes &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-href-https-app-pluralsight-com-library-courses-c-sharp-fundamentals-with-visual-studio-2015-target-blank-alt-pluralsight-c-fundamentals-with-visual-studios-2015-c-fundamentals-with-visual-studio-2015-a&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/c-sharp-fundamentals-with-visual-studio-2015/&#34; target=&#34;\_blank&#34; alt=&#34;PluralSight C# Fundamentals with Visual Studios 2015&#34;&gt; C# Fundamentals With Visual Studio 2015 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after the free tutorials I linked in my Learning C# post, I would still suggest doing this course. Practice makes perfect, and the instructor Scott Allen (on Twitter
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/OdeToCode/&#34; target=&#34;\_blank&#34; alt=&#34;Scott Allen&#39;s Twitter5&#34;&gt; @OdeToCode &lt;/a&gt;
) is great at explaining things. It may be your second or even third time through some of the C# basics, but it won&amp;rsquo;t hurt you and you&amp;rsquo;ll get a chance to explore some related concepts like the Common Language Runtime (CLR), and Object Oriented Programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip :&lt;/strong&gt; If there is a new version of Visual Studios, check for a new version of this course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-href-https-app-pluralsight-com-library-courses-csharp-fundamentals-2-target-blank-alt-pluralsight-c-programming-paradigms-c-programming-paradigms-a&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/csharp-fundamentals-2/&#34; target=&#34;\_blank&#34; alt=&#34;PluralSight C# Programming Paradigms&#34;&gt; C# Programming Paradigms &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course is again by Scott Allen and introduces you to some really powerful C# features. Language Integrated Queries, or LINQ, will become a regular part of your programming once you learn them. The Dynamic Language Runtime, and Functional Programming will give you glimpse at some new ways to think about your programs. Finally, the course wraps up with Scott&amp;rsquo;s 10 rules for writing better C#.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip :&lt;/strong&gt; Even if you know the rest, watch the 10 rules! Scott has been a Microsoft MVP for over 11 years now, take about advice from a pro!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-href-https-app-pluralsight-com-library-courses-csharp-6-whats-new-target-blank-alt-pluralsight-c-6-what-s-new-what-s-new-in-c-6-a&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/csharp-6-whats-new/&#34; target=&#34;\_blank&#34; alt=&#34;PluralSight C# 6 What&#39;s New&#34;&gt; What&amp;rsquo;s New in C# 6 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great chance to get a look at the internals of C#, hear about how the language is changing, and the roadmap it is on. While the last two series will get you started writing great C#, this one will try to save you time by showing you some of the new syntax changes. Also, get ready for you introduction to Roslyn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip :&lt;/strong&gt; If there is a new C# (7 isn&amp;rsquo;t too far away as I write this post), check out that one too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-href-https-app-pluralsight-com-library-courses-clr-fundamentals-target-blank-alt-pluralsight-clr-fundamentals-clr-fundamentals-a&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/clr-fundamentals/&#34; target=&#34;\_blank&#34; alt=&#34;PluralSight CLR Fundamentals&#34;&gt; CLR Fundamentals &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course slows things down with Mike Woodring (another Microsoft MVP) and will explain how all the acronyms you&amp;rsquo;re always hearing work together. From what really is the .Net Framework, to understanding Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation, the Global Assembly Cache (GAC), and even concepts like CLR Interop! If all that sounds like gibberish to you, you know what to do, watch these videos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip :&lt;/strong&gt; Don&amp;rsquo;t skip this one, this low level stuff could save you a lot of time debugging in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-href-https-app-pluralsight-com-library-courses-clr-threading-target-blank-alt-pluralsight-clr-threading-clr-threading-a&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/clr-threading/&#34; target=&#34;\_blank&#34; alt=&#34;PluralSight CLR Threading&#34;&gt; CLR Threading &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many cores does your processor have? I bet it&amp;rsquo;s more than one. I bet it&amp;rsquo;s more than two. You&amp;rsquo;re going to want to use them, so you&amp;rsquo;re going to want to watch this one. It is authored again by Mike Woodring (on Twitter
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mcwoodring&#34; target=&#34;\_blank&#34; alt=&#34;Mike Woodring&#39;s Twitter&#34;&gt; @mcwoodring &lt;/a&gt;
, and he is going to help you get through understanding the main parallel programming concepts, and concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip :&lt;/strong&gt; I didn&amp;rsquo;t use these ideas right away, but when I needed them I was happy to know them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-href-https-app-pluralsight-com-library-courses-net-regular-expressions-target-blank-alt-pluralsight-net-regular-expressions-net-regular-expressions-a&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/net-regular-expressions/&#34; target=&#34;\_blank&#34; alt=&#34;PluralSight .Net Regular Expressions&#34;&gt; .Net Regular Expressions &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost didn&amp;rsquo;t watch this course, but by the end I was happy I did. Regular expressions are used for pattern matching with text. How will you know if a user input string is an email address? Or a phone number? Regular expressions can! Yes, the syntax gets a little (a lot) crazy, but should you ever need to do a lot of text processing you will be happy to know about the power of regular expressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip :&lt;/strong&gt; Turn up the video speed a bit. Get the concepts, you can look up the specifics when you need them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never said it was going to be quick! There is a lot to learn with C#, but thankfully these core skills can be transferred to all types of projects, desktop (WPF, Windows Form, Linux and Mac with .Net Core), mobile (iOS, Android, and Windows with Xamarin), and web-apps (ASP.NET).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more my next building block of courses next week. If you make it through all the above before then, just message me and I&amp;rsquo;ll send you more material you coding beast!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading,&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Should I Learn R or Python?</title>
      <link>http://tiveron.ca/blog/learning-R-or-Python/</link>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;r-or-python-for-data-science&#34;&gt;R or Python for Data Science&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you want to be a data scientist, but are stuck on the first polarizing decision of learning R or Python&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also going to attempt to not make this post follow the typical &amp;ldquo;R is maybe the best, or Python, or neither&amp;rdquo;, as I find these kind of articles informative, but not that helpful. If you are wanting a break down of R and Python&amp;rsquo;s strengths, ease of learning, salaries, etc. you can find soo many with Google, I&amp;rsquo;ll even save you the work of typing it in -  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/?gfe_rd=cr&amp;amp;ei=IV98V8bMLYKN8Qf3vbOwBw#q=R+or+Python&#34; title=&#34;R or Python Google Search Results&#34;&gt;R or Python&lt;/a&gt;.
But while their infographics are detailed and interesting, reviewing them does not help you make the decision of which to start learning. So that is what I&amp;rsquo;ll try to do here, in just two simple questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer : I&amp;rsquo;m neither an R nor a Python expert, but I think my little bit of experience with both can set you on the right path&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-do-have-a-data-set-and-a-problem-in-mind&#34;&gt;1. Do have a data set and a problem in mind?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;yes-r&#34;&gt;Yes - R&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;no-python&#34;&gt;No - Python&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel this question may split developers and academics (generalizing a lot here). Academics typically have a thesis, which is a set problem they are wanting to solve, and are looking to a data science language to beef-up what they might have tried to do in Excel. In contrast, developers, may be wanting to find work with a company and be looking to a data science language to add valuable insight to business data.
With these two needs in mind, I think the academic approaching a problem with a mathematical rigor could find R a great place to start, and the developer looking to hack together business data, could find Python great. Now obviously, I&amp;rsquo;m making some assumptions here, but if you can see yourself fitting into either camp, that would be my advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Choose R - If you have a dataset (sensorlogs.csv, or a database). You&amp;rsquo;re going be able to get up and running very quickly and answering questions with R.
&lt;br&gt;Choose Python - If you need to scrap a website, hack together program outputs, you may need the flexibility of Python to get things together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-do-you-have-programming-experience&#34;&gt;2. Do you have programming experience?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;yes-r-1&#34;&gt;Yes - R&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;no-python-1&#34;&gt;No - Python&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may seem a little reverse, but hear me out. The simple approach is to say if you have programming experience, you can learn Python quickly and be solving problems in no time; while learning R is an entirely new beast. However, I think that if you already know how to program, you can use that language to solve the parts of your problem which R would not be as strong at. For example, if you want to build an entire application and require some data analysis. You can build the application in your known language, then introduce R to crunch data as required. Now in contrast, if you have no programming experience, I think you should learn Python. The journey of learning will always open new and unforeseen doors. If a year from now you need to build a web service, you probably won&amp;rsquo;t get far with R there. Most people will not get a job where they are doing pure data science all the time. If you end up needing to develop something, you will probably need other tools. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have other tools, learn Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Choose R - If you already have a working understanding of another programming language.
&lt;br&gt;Choose Python - If you have never programmed before, as you can do almost anything with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-choice-is-yours&#34;&gt;The Choice Is Yours&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to see R as a really fancy calculator, and I&amp;rsquo;m talking really fancy, fancier than even a &lt;a href=&#34;https://education.ti.com/en/us/products/calculators/graphing-calculators/ti-89-titanium/features/features-summary&#34; title=&#34;TI-89 Titanium&#34;&gt;Titanium TI-89&lt;/a&gt;. This isn&amp;rsquo;t meant to be an insult! On my desk I always have my calculator next to me (yes I know there is one on my computer), but my calculator is better because it is specialized. R could be the best choice for you if you have data, even dirty data. Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a clearly defined goal with that data, R has many great tools for exploring and visualizing that data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Python on the other hand, I see as good kitchen knife (where do I come up with these metaphors??). Sure there are specialized knives, pairing, steak, bread, etc. But for tackling the biggest variety of jobs, that kitch&amp;hellip; err Python is going to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to repeat myself like a broken record (I do similes too). If you have data, or get to work with just data choose R, especially if you already know a different programming language to handle any other development needs. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know any other programming language, or need to create something to generate your data choose Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know everyone won&amp;rsquo;t agree with me, and rightfully so. I also had to generalize a fair bit to try to draw a clear line between the two, but I hope I was able to help you. As always, if you have any further questions about my suggestions please reach out to me with any of the links below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading,&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning C#</title>
      <link>http://tiveron.ca/blog/learning-csharp/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2&gt; Should I Learn C#? &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why should you choose to learn C# out of all the other languages? Perhaps you are trying to decided between it and Java, or Python, or C, or JavaScript, or [insert other great language choice].
Well quite simply you should choose C# to learn now, because C# is the best! &amp;hellip; Is what I wish I could say, but truly there are many different programming languages and most have varying pros and cons for many applications. With the disclaimer that there is certainly no &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo;, C# has many great features and is a good beginner language. People smarter than I have written great and thorough articles on why to choose C#, linked below is just a small sampling. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to repeat them here, but have summarized what I think are some great points below. Additionally, I have included some content to get you on your way learning C#.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Sampling of why you should learn C# references:&lt;/h4&gt;
 - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bestprogramminglanguagefor.me/why-learn-c-sharp&#34; title=&#34;Best Programming Language For Me - C#&#34;&gt;Why Learn C#&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.opensesame.com/blog/six-reasons-why-you-should-learn-c&#34; title=&#34;OpenSesame - 6 Reason to Learn C#&#34;&gt;6 Reasons To Learn C#&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hanselman.com/blog/IfYouHadToStartOverWhatTechnologiesWouldYouLearnIn2014.aspx&#34; title=&#34;Scott Hanselman - If you had to start over learning...&#34;&gt;If You Had To Start Over Learning&amp;hellip; &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Common syntax&lt;/strong&gt; - you&amp;rsquo;ll get used to {curly braces}. This should help make it easier for you to read other curly brace languages, at least enough to get the gist of what the code is doing. This is very helpful, as sometimes you will only be able to find code examples in other languages, so being able to quickly interpret other code and get your C# code underway is a big bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High level language&lt;/strong&gt; - takes care of a lot of the little details and lets you get going. Now this isn&amp;rsquo;t to say it handles everything for you, but you will get good mileage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Huge community&lt;/strong&gt; - If you are unfamiliar with &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/&#34; title=&#34;Stack Overflow&#34;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;, you soon won&amp;rsquo;t be! C# has the 4th largest community on Stack Overflow. This means if you have a problem, someone else probably has had it too, and you can find a solution here quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can write pretty much anything, anywhere&lt;/strong&gt; - Microsoft loves open source if you hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard! With the release of &lt;a href=&#34;https://dotnet.github.io/&#34; title=&#34;.Net Core&#34;&gt;.Net Core&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.visualstudio.com/&#34; title=&#34;Visual Studio Code&#34;&gt;Visual Studio - Code&lt;/a&gt; you can now program C# on any platform in Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; C# IDE Visual Studio. This means yes to Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux; and this means yes to desktop, web, and mobile applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; Getting Started Learning C# &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone learns differently so I&amp;rsquo;m going to include a couple different methods for learning C# which hopefully you will find useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got started learning C# with the course &lt;a href=&#34;https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169?l=Lvld4EQIC_2706218949&#34; title=&#34;C# on MVA&#34;&gt;C# For Beginners on Microsoft Virtual Academy&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft Virtual Academy has a plethora of free content to help anyone at any level get underway with many Microsoft technologies, and the best part is it is all free! This is probably the best way to get your feet wet with C#, it has around 8 hours of video tutorials, split into 24 modules, with 21 assessments. The 24 modules are great for when you are busy and can&amp;rsquo;t allocate a big chunk of time to learning all at once. Just complete a module or two when you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried this one myself, but if you tend to learn more through reading another free learning service by Microsoft is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/net/tutorials/csharp/getting-started&#34; title=&#34;Getting Started with C#&#34;&gt;Getting Started with C#&lt;/a&gt;. This text based tutorial appears to cover many of the same topics as the Microsoft Virtual Academy course. This could also be a great option for learning on the go on your mobile or if you live in a region with slow or intermittent internet access. These tutorials will even get you coding C# right in the browser, no need to download anything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well there you have it, you should consider learning C# as it has a bright future and seems like it should be an in demand language for years to come. Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s recent moves to open source the .Net Framework and huge cross platform support will only increase C#&amp;rsquo;s popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that the links above help you get started on C# and stay tuned for how to take your C# skills to the next level!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: When you are ready to take your C# to the next level check out my next blog post for you here : &lt;a href=&#34;http://tiveron.ca/blog/csharp-advanced-foundations/&#34; title=&#34;Thomas Tiveron&#39;s C# - Advanced Foundations&#34;&gt;C# - Advanced Foundations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-i-ve-started-my-blog&#34;&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve started my blog!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_3&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the content, hold onto your seats people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a big podcast fan (&lt;a href=&#34;https://player.fm/ttiveron/fm&#34; title=&#34;Thomas&#39;s PlayerFM Channel&#34;&gt;check out my PlayerFM channel&lt;/a&gt;),
I often heard the benefits of sharing your knowledge from many people, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/shanselman&#34;&gt;Scott Hanselman&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jsonmez&#34;&gt;Jon Sonmez&lt;/a&gt;.
They preach that sharing your journey will not only help you retain what you are learning, create an excellent portfolio, but you may also help/inspire someone else to tackle new challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I decided to leap and started this blog a little over a month ago, but like anyone who likes to tinker with technology, I took the long road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;domains-hosting-servers-cms-oh-wow&#34;&gt;Domains, Hosting, Servers, CMS, Oh WOW&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first technical challenge which will siphon hours of Google research is where will your blog live??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew I wanted my own domain and settled on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.namecheap.com/&#34; title=&#34;Namescheap&#34;&gt;Namecheap&lt;/a&gt; because they had the best value for domain registration and email hosting.
Some services offer many more features, but seeing as I will not be requiring a lot of features for this simple blog, Namecheap&amp;rsquo;s offering was perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following my domain purchase and email setup, I stared down the barrel of hosting options and blogging platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reviewed hosting with Dreamhost, Digital Ocean, and a few others. I reviewed VPS options like Azure, and Linode (wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be fun to admin a Linux server!).
And I considered your classic WordPress, and the new blogging focused Ghost platforms.
But at the end of the day, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really want to have to start paying for a hosting subscription at the start, and then I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34; title=&#34;Github Pages&#34;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;github-pages-and-static-site-generators&#34;&gt;Github Pages and Static Site Generators&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Github Pages will serve the content in a Github repository as a website, with the catch that everything in the repository has to be static.
So while you could create the content and HTML of each page, you can use a static site generator to take care of the HTML for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now here is where the real fun begins, choosing a static site generator.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.staticgen.com/&#34; title=&#34;StaticGen&#34;&gt;StaticGen&lt;/a&gt; tracks the top Open-Source static site generators and their list contains well over 100!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hexo.io/&#34; title=&#34;Hexo&#34;&gt;Hexo.io&lt;/a&gt; was my first static generator. I chose Hexo, because it ranked high on the  list of generators and runs a node.js server.
I do not have much experience with JavaScript, but I felt that if I needed to code something to go along with node.js it would be good experience.
Unfortunately, my love of Hexo was short lived. They have great tutorials, and I was able to get my site up very quickly, but when I wanted to dig into the theme and make some changes things got tricky.
Hexo themes use either the template language EmbeddedJavaScript (EJS) or Swig, and I&amp;rsquo;m currently not interested in learning either of these.
Thus, while I was able to get my Hexo site up and running smoothly, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to tackle their foreign templating language just to make theme changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I moved onto the next generator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing that some experience with the underlying language may be advantageous I decided to try &lt;a href=&#34;http://wyam.io/&#34; title=&#34;Wyam&#34;&gt;Wyam.io&lt;/a&gt; next.
Wyam is a static &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; generator written entirely in .NET, and allows for templating in Markdown and Razor. I used Wyam for a couple of days before deciding it was too complex.
Wyam is a lot more than just a static site (simple blog) generator. Wyam is used by chaining together flexible modules to produce your end product,
and while you can create a website this way it seemed like overkill (to me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io/&#34; title=&#34;Hugo&#34;&gt;goHugo.io&lt;/a&gt; (another .io)!
Hugo is very similar to Hexo. Both have great documentation, easy setup guides, and awesome themes.
Hugo was different for me because the entire application is written in Go. While Go is vastly less popular than JavaScript, I have been trying to find time to use Go all year.
Hugo&amp;rsquo;s themes use Go templating and they have a great primer in their documentation. So far the minor changes I have wanted to make have been pretty simple.
It feels more like I&amp;rsquo;m making simple HTML changes, with the power of Go objects and conditionals.
Finally, another important aspect to me was that with Hugo you create your content in Markdown files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you have it, a short summary of the meandering trail I took to get here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about my choices feel free to reach out to me with any of the links below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tl-dr&#34;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to focus on backend solutions where I can flex my mathematical muscle :p &lt;br&gt;
  I&amp;rsquo;m blogging to share my journey on learning to become a better software developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;longer-version&#34;&gt;Longer version,&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently working remotely with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.icarusgv.com/&#34; title=&#34;IcarusGV Homepage&#34;&gt;Icarus Group Ventures&lt;/a&gt; a small FinTech start-up.
  I was initially solely in the role of manager; planning, scheduling, hiring,
  but when you work on a small team you get the chance to tackle many different challenges. Over the past two years,
  I have been able to add value through coding, mostly C#. I also now admin a series of Windows Servers for our cloud-only infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple years I have worked with either small start-ups, or on small teams contracted by large companies to solve a specific problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the start-up realm, I&amp;rsquo;ve helped get multiple ideas funded and a couple to market. Helping people get from an idea to a workable plan can be a big challenge,
  but the results are often rewarding. The start-ups I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with have been under 5 members and are mostly in need of planning and prototyping.
  A lot of the work at this stage is idea validation, which means figuring out if there is a genuine need, and if it can be profitable (or sustainable).
  Getting good answers here can solve a lot of heartache and hard work. In fact over half the start-ups I&amp;rsquo;ve helped with their research have decided against
  pursuing funding, but this is just what you want at an early stage - Fail Fast! Learn the lessons, and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my work on contract teams, I&amp;rsquo;m usually solving a company/industry specific problem with a tight schedule and fixed budget. My background in civil engineering
  usually comes into play here, where I look to bring a digital solution to an analog problem. Sometimes, there are fulltime developers, and I take on a liaison role filtering key
  engineering concepts into psuedocode or ensuring the logic adequately reflects real world processes. Other times, I&amp;rsquo;m the developer and often in this scenario a key
  factor is integration. Fitting a new application or process into a company&amp;rsquo;s current work flow and culture can be tricky. Early communication between stakeholders &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; end-users is key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to Ryerson University (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) and completed a Bachelor of Civil Engineering, followed by a Masters of Applied Science there too.
  It was during my master&amp;rsquo;s thesis that I was first introduced to programming, translating some old VB6 code to VB.Net and Silverlight.
  Since then I have tackled numerous small coding projects. I have done some work in Python (2 &amp;amp; 3), a little more in R, and a little less on the front-end (HTML &amp;amp; CSS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia is currently my crush, don&amp;rsquo;t tell my wife&amp;hellip; Blogs about JuliaLang to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve made it this far thank you,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas&lt;/p&gt;
